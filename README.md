# Packrat_HowTo

Tutorial and explanation of reproducible package management with R and Packrat. Read the [tutorial](./Tutorial.md) and have a look at the [example code](./Packrat_HowTo.R).

* This repository does not represent an entire Packrat repository. 
* You can get the entire Packrat repository by 
  * copying [the example](./Packrat_HowTo.R) to a local R project (*not recommended* - Packrat might expect another folder structure),
  * cloning the repository into a local folder.
  * Then work through the example. ```packrat::init()``` should be enough to build the Packrat repository.
  * Using the GUI in RStudio should also work.
